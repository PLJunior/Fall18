# PL Junior

PL Junior is a tradition of Northeastern's Programming Research Laboratory since ????. It is a weekly meeting of mostly first and second year phd students studying and discussing a variety of topics in programming languages research. However, anyone interested in learning PL topics is welcome.

### Sept 17

**Topic**: Intro to CPS  
**Guest lecturer**: William Bowmen  
**Outline of the lecture**:  
1. What is CPS?
   Continuation-Passing style, and transformations from direct style in CPS.
2. Why CPS?
   - Making control-flow explicit
     Used in concurrent programming, such as GUI programming (call-backs are
     continuations).
   - Making evaluation order explicit
     Need to force evaluation to a value in CBN, or force CBN on a CBV machine.
   - Internalize the evaluation context
     To express control effects internally in the language.
   - A translation that makes values and computation distinct.
     Bad news: code is not actually data.
2. Untyped CPS
   - "Plotkin's translation"
    - CBV
    - CBN
   - translating the evaluation context directly.
   - machine semantics
   - naturality
3. Typed CPS
   - value vs computation vs programs (and their types)
   - "Double negation"
   - Fixed answer type
     - Actually, this is double negation to.
   - Locally polymoprhic answer type
     - Actually, this is double negation to.
