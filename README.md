# PL Junior

PL Junior is a tradition of Northeastern's Programming Research Laboratory since ????. It is a weekly meeting of mostly first and second year phd students studying and discussing a variety of topics in programming languages research. However, anyone interested in learning PL topics is welcome.

### Sept 17

**Topic**: Intro to CPS  
**Guest lecturer**: William Bowmen  
**Outline of the lecture**:  
1. What is CPS?
   Continuation-Passing style, and transformations from direct style in CPS.
2. Why CPS?
   - Making control-flow explicit
     Used in concurrent programming, such as GUI programming (call-backs are
     continuations).
   - Making evaluation order explicit
     Need to force evaluation to a value in CBN, or force CBN on a CBV machine.
   - Internalize the evaluation context
     To express control effects internally in the language.
   - A translation that makes values and computation distinct.
     Bad news: code is not actually data.
2. Untyped CPS
   - "Plotkin's translation"
    - CBV
    - CBN
   - translating the evaluation context directly.
   - machine semantics
   - naturality
3. Typed CPS
   - value vs computation vs programs (and their types)
   - "Double negation"
   - Fixed answer type
     - Actually, this is double negation to.
   - Locally polymoprhic answer type
     - Actually, this is double negation to.

Progress: Page 6 --10 (Before section 5)  
Notes:  
  The original Fischer transformation,$F$, is correct, but the presence of administrative redexes are undesirable.  
  Hence, modified Fischer CPS, $F2$, is introduced. $F2$ is a two-pass transformation in which    
   - First pass marks the new lambda abstractions to identify administrative redexes and
   - Second pass reduces all administrative redexes.  

  The paper proves $F2$ is a total function meaning F2 is defined on all source terms and "correctly" CPS transforms them in finite amount of time using the Church-Rosser normal form theorem.  

  Plotkin proved some interesting theorems about the relation between reductions on source terms and CPS terms.  
  They revealed that $\beta$-reductions  prove more equations on CPS terms that $\beta_v$-reductions prove on source terms.  
  The paper tries to remedy this by proving  
  \[
  \lambda_v A \vdash M = N \iff \lambda \beta \eta \vdash F2[M] = F2[N]
  \]
  where $A$ is a set of axioms needed for this equivalence or simulation between source and corresponding CPS programs to hold.  
  However, some complications to this problem is presented.  
  One example is a CPS term reduces to a term that contains an administrative redex and hence cannot be $F2[M]$ for any $M \in \Lambda$.  
  However, it is provably equal to a number of CPS terms, among which introduces the inverse of the term.  
  Inspired by this example, the authors proceed the following which will be presented in section 5.  
  - Definition of a one-pass CPS transformation equivalent to $F2$
  - Inverse of CPS transformation and its relationship to the CPS transformations
  - Set A, the derived axiom set, needed for the source language to have equivalent equations that CPS programs have
